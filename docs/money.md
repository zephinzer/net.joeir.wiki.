# Money Matters

The following assumes you're residing in Singapore.

## Notes

1. You are not taxed on capital gains in Singapore
2. If you're trading in U.S. markets, be aware that there's [a 30% tax on dividends](https://blog.seedly.sg/us-stock-investing-taxes-and-fees/)
3. Dividends do add up

## Brokerages

For trading in the U.S. market, use Saxo or TD Ameritrade.
